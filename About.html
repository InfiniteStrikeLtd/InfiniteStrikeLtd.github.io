                        <hr/>
                        <p>Infinite strike is an indie game developement studio.</p><br/>
                        <p>Infinite Strike was created in 2010 by an 11 year-old boy whose dream was to
                        sell comics and make stories. It was originally named Draven's Anime and Manga, but fearing 
                        that I would get in trouble for selling comics at school I changed the name. Infinite Strike Manga
                        or ISM and we went with that. In 2011 the name was changed to ISMedia as I found a new love
                        for the multimedia arts such as YouTube. Finally we settled with Infinite Strike. We stood for
                        programming and games and that was about it.</p>
