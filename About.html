        <h1> About</h1>

        <p style="font-size:20px;">Hey, and welcome to Infinite Strike! First off thanks, for taking an interest in our “About” area!
            <br>Now if you have noticed, we lack in a sense of professionalism. That is true but we do is intentionally, we don’t believe in the cold, bold look of A company that talks like a robot. instead we talk to you, like you would talk to you. we treat you as a person and guarantee that a human is always behind the keyboard that is behind the creation of our website and other products, never a robot.
            <br>That is why you would see use of Friendly words like "Oops", if something were to go wrong. So hey, thanks and now we have some rules below so read them.
        </p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">History time! Infinite Strike was created in May of 2010 as a project of an 11 year old boy, he was interested in Anime and Manga. So one day he thought it would be cool to make stories and sell them to his friends. He created Draven's Anime And Manga. He sold some copies but he feared that his school would not like this and since his name was on the books he feared that they would be tracked back to him so he proceed to rename his comic company. He went thorough many names like XComicX and other things of that matter, but he wanted something strong that would as powerful, like a sword that was swung infinitely. An Infinite Strike, he named his company Infinite Strike Manga or ISM. Later he found the internet and began making YouTube content and was called ISMedia, he didn't do well. later he got into programming and wasn't very good and started making games and other stuff like that. Finally he created Infinite Strike. I created Infinite Strike. This small start-up went from an 11 year-old's dream to a reality.
            <br/>Thank you - Draven Lewis (Ceo)</p>
