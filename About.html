                        <h1>About Infinite Strike</h1>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>Infinite strike is what we like to call a creative outlet for all who want to join.
                        We appear as a company but work as a community of people who enjoy one common thing,
                        and that is creativity. Infinite Strike is not a company we are a group. We are talented
                        artists, animators, singers, directors, programmers, designers and so much more.
                        When you are in the Infinite Strike network you are one of us..</p><br/>
                        <p>Infinite Strike was created in 2010 by an 11 year-old boy whose dream was to
                        sell comics and make stories. It was originally named Draven's Anime and Manga, but fearing 
                        that I would get in trouble for selling comics at school I changed the name. Infinite Strike Manga
                        or ISM and we went with that. In 2011 the name was changed to ISMedia as I found a new love
                        for the multimedia arts such as YouTube. Finally we settled with Infinite Strike. We stood for
                        programming and games and that was about it. So I started thinking, we need to become more. We
                        need to become a true hub for creators. Drop the Games and add it to our list of things we stand
                        for. Now Infinite Strike is an amazing new place for Coders and Designers alike. and i welcome you
                        to the new Infinite Strike.</p>
